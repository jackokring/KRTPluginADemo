This is a set of demo files for the [KRTPluginA](https://github.com/jackokring/KRTPluginA) VCV Rack plugin repository. It might also include builds for linux of the plugin (**-lin.zip**).

Files not allowed in the main repository because of build pipeline requirements might be here too, such as pictures.

If will try to archive the repository to a **.zip** file if the files might not match the publically available [Plugin Build](https://library.vcvrack.com/KRTPluginA) as I save new test patches or changes. Hopefully, this means that people having only the public build from the official library may still open the files in the provided zip files by version number.
