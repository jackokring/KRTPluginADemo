# Captain's Log `KRTPluginJ`

[Latest](#Latest) Auto jump to where the "edit limit" is plus addition forward ... Auto insert on save?

So the `make` works, but te modules are nowhere near ready. I'm making the "standard" `plugin.cpp`/`plugin.hpp` for all my future plugins. A generic project starter. I've abstracted the edits when making modules to be in `modules.hpp` (for the list of module sources) and `menus.txt` (for the context menus and threaded signalling).

Sayc, sarc .ASM a bound?

I've added `make macjig` to force `menus.txt` change recompilation. A stop gap as `.hpp` er, should standardly work, 'cos like that's how `.cpp` lines of `#include` go like man. Owe quey, reda di Manuelle Jaw de sure like man?

Next!

I vont to vrock'it into spass. Like a moo-sycle style like so man, hey dudumdida, ho, yes, or "well it's like the loader is like flawed, but excellent, but needs a stop 'till end then go, as an easy man." 2023-03-02 yes either same TB-303*2.

Yes, the build system should now be better. It follows a few botches and generic code hacks. So now I'm thinking about maybe other languages to add. I though LOGO for fun, but `TO NAME :VAR` is all wrong. It should've been `TO "NAME "VAR` for evaluation consistency. As an adult it makes lisp `macro` look useful but primarily avoided to remove one letter and add much in the source code. Implicit `"` is kind of cool in `setq`, but suffers from inconsitency, and as a learner lingo distracted by pizza turtles and living in the sewer, erm, is it really the daddy or the diddy, butt wee wont go win to dat?

Hi ho. Next up (no `postscipt` although cool, has much to  blit and little to command line decompose).  ~~I~~ So `netpbm` is graphically cool in a textual number data format. I wonder about that fractal algorithm, as it reminds me of the `.fif` file extension from the really early '90s. I managed to recompress the uncompressed residual in a loop at 50% quality and after 3 iterations it was better than 100%b in less time, even though an archive `.zip` of the multiple outputs was required.
