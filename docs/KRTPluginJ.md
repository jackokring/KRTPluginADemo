# Captain's Log `KRTPluginJ`

So the `make` works, but te modules are nowhere near ready. I'm making the "standard" `plugin.cpp`/`plugin.hpp` for all my future plugins. A generic project starter. I've abstracted the edits when making modules to be in `modules.hpp` (for the list of module sources) and `menus.txt` (for the context menus and threaded signalling).
