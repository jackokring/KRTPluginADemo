# Captain's Log `KRTPluginJ`

So the `make` works, but te modules are nowhere near ready. I'm making the "standard" `plugin.cpp`/`plugin.hpp` for all my future plugins. A generic project starter. I've abstracted the edits when making modules to be in `modules.hpp` (for the list of module sources) and `menus.txt` (for the context menus and threaded signalling).

Sayc, sarc .ASM a bound?

I've added `make macjig` to force `menus.txt` change recompilation. A stop gap as `.hpp` er, should standardly work, 'cos like that's how `.cpp` lines of `#include` go like man. Owe quey, reda di Manuelle Jaw de sure like man?

Next!

I vont to vrock'it into spass. Like a moo-sycle style like so man, hey dudumdida, ho, yes, or "well it's like the loader is like flawed, but excellent, but needs a stop 'till end then go, as an easy man." 2023-03-02 yes either same TB-303*2.

Yes, the build system should now be better. It follows a few botches and generic code hacks. So now I'm thinking about maybe other languages to add. I though LOGO for fun, but `TO NAME :VAR` is all wrong. It should've been `TO "NAME "VAR` for evaluation consistency.
