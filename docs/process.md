# Hi ... The Process

So building a master (although tags help) does leave it open for `git clone <repo>` not used tags before. VCV central do provide a cross-platform compile (Win/Lin/Mac) on a commit SHA so that's good.

I'd go fortnightly on the "CI build of plugin" (the library site one) thread as the person likely has many "stability and as described" issues. Automation of a code "throw" to many potential "executors" without some forethought isn't a good idea.

Keep **ALL** non instrument code such as example patches and large build for mates binaries **OFF** the main plugin repository.

You maybe code blind to how you see your module, but yes, I've miss-labelled IO before.
